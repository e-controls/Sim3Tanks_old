%% Fault signals to simulink
% The fault signals must satisfy the following properties:
%    1) be a column vector;
%    2) have the same number of samples as time vector;
%    3) do not have NaN in its samples;
%    4) do not have Inf in its samples;
%    5) all values of its samples must be between [0,1].
% Use the function "check_fault_signal(fsignal)" to check these properties,
% for more info, type "help check_fault_signal" in the command window.

% Example: replace "F1.signals.values = fsignal" for:
% F1.signals.values = mysaturation(sin(0.0125*pi*time),0,1);

% >> To see the new F1 signal:
% 1. Save this file;
% 2. Back to Simulink and run simulation;
% 3. Go to subsystem "fault generator" and open F1 scope.
